			<p>
				The AS3Commons project is dedicated to one principal goal: creating and
				maintaining reusable ActionScript 3.0 components. This is a place
				for collaboration and sharing, where developers from throughout the
				community can work together on projects to be shared.
</p>
			<p>

				AS3Commons developers will make an effort to ensure that their components have
				minimal dependencies on other libraries, so that these components
				can be deployed easily. In addition, AS3Commons components will keep
				their interfaces as stable as possible, so that users (including
				other AS3Commons projects) can implement these components without
				having to worry about changes in the future.
</p>
			<p>
				We welcome participation from all that are interested, at all skill
				levels. Coding, documentation and testing are all critical parts of
				the software development process. If you are interested in
				participating in any of these aspects, please join us!
</p>
			<p>	All libraries are also available in the Maven repository at 
				<a href="http://projects.yoolab.org/maven/content/repositories/releases/org/as3commons" target="_blank">

			<tr>
				<td><strong>Logging</strong></td>
				<td>An abstraction over logging framework implementations. Being a pure actionscript library it can be used for any Flash/Flex/AIR project. Its use is recommended for use with other libraries/framework trying to be logging framework agnostic.</td>
				<td>2.7</td>
				<td>14 Oct 2011</td>

				<td>16 Oct 2011</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>Reflect</strong></td>
				<td>A reflection API for ActionScript 3.0. Being a pure actionscript library it can be used for any Flash/Flex/AIR project. It functions as a wrapper for the native describeType and describeTypeJSON methods. Results are statically cached to improve performance.</td>
				<td>1.5</td>
				<td>23 Sep 2011</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>Serialization</strong></td>

			<tr>
				<td><strong>UI</strong></td>
				<td>Algorithms and managers to serve common UI releated tasks such as layouting, focus and keyboard management, popup handling, drag and drop control and so on.
